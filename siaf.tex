\subsection{COS SIAF History}\label{subsec:siafhistory}
The pre-SM4 COS Science Instrument Aperture File (SIAF) is described in detail in Mallo, 2008.
The active COS entries in the 2018 SIAF, and the [V2,V3] aperture positions are given in Table~\ref{tab:activesiaf}.
The changes since SMOV to the COS SIAF, and the continuing Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) re-alignment efforts are
documented in Table~\ref{tab:siafhistory}.
This table includes all NUV LP1 and FUV LP1--4 entries. Each LP contains entries for the BOA, PSA, BOA when the PSA is being used, and PSA when the BOA is being used.

\input{extrasiaf/siafhistory.tex}

The COS SIAF ``Aperture Names''  start with the ``L"", and are followed by either an ``N'' (NUV), ``F'' (FUV), or
``APT''' indicating that the aperture is only used in APT and not for observations.
``APT'' in the APT entries are immediately followed by an ``N'' or ``F''.
The SA (BOA or PSA) or MAC then follows. MAC represents the APT/SPSS\footnote{SPSS=Science Planning and Scheduling System} MACro aperture used for bright object checking.
Finally, FUV entries end in a number giving the LP\#, while the NUV ``offset'' apertures end with ``OF''.
An illustration of the active COS SIAF entries is given in Figure~\ref{fig:SIAF1}. As described in the individual
FUV LP enabling ISRs, the location of each LP aperture is determined by first selecting the desired XD location on the FUV detector segments. After this selection,
an AD aperture scan, using \texttt{POS\_TARGs} in APT, determines the SIAF entry adjustment corresponding to
the desired LP [V2,V3] aperture center. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SIAF1}, this alignment procedure produces
a series of aperture locations that are at an $\approx$ 44.2$\degree$ angle to the -V3 (U3) axis.

The orientation of the COS AD and XD directions in relation to the HST mechanical [V2,V3] coordinates
and U-frame are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ADXDV23}. The HST U-frame of [U2,U3]=[-V2,-V3] and is used by APT
and SPSS.  Converting the orientation shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SIAF1} to
the nomenclature of the SIAF, the COS FUV apertures are aligned as follows:
$\beta_{x}=135.8\degree$, $\beta_y=45.8\degree$, and parity=+1. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SIAF1}, for COS:
\begin{eqnarray}
\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
AD = [+V2,-V3]\label{eq:ADV23}\\
XD = [+V2,+V3]\label{eq:XDV23}\\
V2 = [+AD,+XD]\label{eq:V2ADXD}\\
V3 = [-AD,+XD]\label{eq:V3ADXD}
\end{eqnarray}
\normalsize
The NUV coordinate system orientation was measured during SMOV (Hartig et al., 2010 and Goudfrooij et al., 2010).
This NUV angle was determined to be 0.52 $\pm 0.01\degree$ from +Y \texttt{POS\_TARG} in the +X \texttt{POS\_TARG} direction
($\beta_{x}=135.5\degree$, $\beta_y=45.5\degree$). The COS SIAF currently uses $\beta_{x}=135\degree$, $\beta_y=45\degree$ for both NUV and FUV.
All conversions between [AD,XD] and [V2,V3] in this ISR use the current SIAF values for  $\beta_{x}$ and $\beta_{y}$.
The conversion between [V2,V3] and [AD,XD] in terms of $\beta_{x}$ and $\beta_{y}$ are :\footnote{See http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/apertures/siaf.html}
\begin{eqnarray}
\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
	V2 = S_{AD} \cdot sin(\beta_x) \cdot XD	+ S_{XD} \cdot sin(\beta_y) \cdot XD \label{eq:V2beta}\label{eq:V2BETA}\\
	V3 = S_{XD} \cdot cos(\beta_x) \cdot XD	+ S_{XD} \cdot cos(\beta_y) \cdot XD \label{eq:V3beta}\label{eq:V3BETA}
\end{eqnarray}
Where, $S_{AD}$ is the AD plate scale (0.02352\arcsec/p), $S_{XD}$ is the XD plate scale (0.02362\arcsec/p ), and the aperture center was taken as the reference point.

The U ([U2,U3]=[-V2,-V3]) frame is used during the proposal process in APT and SPSS. The lower panel (Osbourne, 2004) shows all the pre-launch COS coordinate
systems. From left to right, the ``P''hysical coordinate system is aligned with
the COS enclosure, and shares a common origin with the [X,Y,Z] ``DET''ector coordinates.
The X, Y, and Z axes of the STOPT (Space Telescope OPTical) coordinate system are shown slightly below and aft of these.
The HST [V1,V2,V3] coordinate system is shown on the right.\label{fig:ADXDV23}}
