\subsection{SIAF Verification} \label{sec:siaf}\label{subsec:siafextra}
The pre-SM4 COS Science Instrument Aperture File is described in detail in Mallo 2008. The changes
since SMOV to the COS SIAF, and the continuing Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) re-alignment efforts are
documented it Table~\ref{tab:siafhistory}. The COS entries in the 2018 SIAF, and the [V2,V3] positions are given in Table~\ref{tab:activesiaf}.

The COS SIAF ``Aperture Names''  start with the ``L"", and are followed by either an ``N'' (NUV), ``F'' (FUV), or
``APT''' indicating that the aperture is only used in APT and not for observations.
``APT'' in the APT entries are immediately followed by an ``N'' or ``F''.
The SA (BOA or PSA) or MAC then follows. MAC represents the APT/SPSS MACro aperture used for bright object checking.
Finally, FUV entries end in a number giving the LP\#, while the NUV ''offset'' aperturens end with ``OF''.
An illustration of the active COS SIAF entries is given in Figure~\ref{fig:SIAF1}. As described in the individual
FUV LP enabling ISRs (Penton, 201X (LP2), Penton 201Y(LP3), and Penton 201Z (LP4)), the location of each LP aperture
is determined by first selecting the desired XD location on the FUV detector segments. After this selection,
an AD aperture scan, using \textit{POS\_TARGs} in APT, determines the SIAF entry adjustment corresponding to
the desired LP [V2,V3] aperture center. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig;SIAF1}, this alignment procedure produces
a series of aperture locations that are at an $\approx$ 44.2$\degree$ angle to the -V3 (U3) axis.

The orientation of the COS AD and XD directions in relation to the HST mechanical [V2,V3] coordinates
and U-frame are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ADXDV23}. The HST U-frame of [U2,U3]=[-V2,-V3] and is used by APT
and SPSS\footnote{SPSS=Science Planning and Scheduling System}.  Converting the orientation shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SIAF1} to
the nomenclature of the SIAF, the COS FUV apertures are aligned as follows:
$\beta_{x}=135.8\degree$, $\beta_y=45.8\degree$, and parity=+1. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SIAF1}, the COS AD direction is [+V2,-V3],
while XD is [+V2,+V3].
