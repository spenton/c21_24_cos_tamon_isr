\subsection{COS TA Centering Requirements}\label{subsec:requirements}

The COS TA centering requirements are based upon the wavelength accuracy requirements in the AD, and for flux and resolution optimization
in the XD.\footnote{The COS requirements are documented in the CEI (Contract End Item) Specification (Smith et. al., 2004).} The strictest NUV requirements are [AD,XD] = [0.041, 0.3]\arcsec, while for the FUV they are [AD,XD] = [0.106, 0.3]\arcsec.\footnote{While the XD requirement for all TAs is $\pm$ 0.3\arcsec, our 1$\sigma$ goal is $\pm$ 0.1\arcsec. This goal ensures that spectra fall on a consistent XD location on the the detector, which aids in extraction and calibration accuracy.}
Since the AD requirement is in units of \kmsno, it is detector, grating, and wavelength dependent as defined in equations~\ref{eq:TAcenter}--\ref{eq:TAcenterL}.

\Delta\ AD(G185M@@1825\AA) = {{ 15\kms \times 1825\AA}\over{c \times 0 .037\AA/p\times 42.47 p/\arcsec}}  = 0.058\arcsec\\

\Delta\ AD(G160M@@1600\AA) = {{ 15\kms \times 1600\AA}\over{c \times 0.01223\AA/ p\times 42.9 p/\arcsec}} = 0.153\arcsec\\
\Delta\ AD(G140L@@1800\AA) = {{150\kms \times 1800\AA}\over{c \times 0.08030\AA/ p\times 45.4 p/\arcsec}} = 0.247\arcsec\label{eq:TAcenterL}
\end{eqnarray}

Assuming that the wavelength error budget is split evenly between the COS TA and wavelength scale accuracies,
the error budgets for the COS gratings, in arc-seconds (\arcsec), are given in Table~\ref{tab:TAaccuracy}. By ``evenly'' we mean that when added in quadrature the total error budget is that given by the second column of Table~\ref{tab:TAaccuracy}.
Setting the TA error budget equal to the wavelength scale accuracy, the AD TA requirement given in the third column is the second column divided by $\sqrt{2}$.

For COS TA, we take the CEI spec (0.3\arcsec) to refer to the required centering accuracy in the XD, and the wavelength requirements to apply to
the TA accuracy required in the AD direction. Since the AD requirement is in units of \kmsno, it is detector and wavelength
dependent as defined in equations~\ref{eq:TAcenter}--\ref{eq:TAcenterL}.
Assuming that the wavelength error budget is split evenly between the COS TA and wavelength scale accuracies,
the error budgets for the COS gratings, in arc-seconds (\arcsec), are given in Table~\ref{tab:TAaccuracy}. By ``evenly'' we mean that when added in quadrature the total error budget is that given by the second column of Table~\ref{tab:TAaccuracy}.
