\section{COS TA Operations Summary}\label{sec:TAoperations}

There are three modes of Target Acquisition (TA) for the Cosmic Origins Spectograph (COS); NUV imaging, NUV spectroscopic, and FUV spectroscopic.
There are four COS TA (\tacq{}) procedures; \tacq{IMAGE}, \tacq{PEAKD}, \tacq{PEAKXD}, and \tacq{SEARCH}.
\tacq{PEAKD} and \tacq{SEARCH} step the telescope through dwell patterns on the sky.
As long as the target light falls correctly within the TA detector sub-arrays, \tacq{PEAKD} and \tacq{SEARCH} will continue to nominally assist in TA (barring any unforeseen anomalies, such as detector `hot-spots').
The \tacq{IMAGE} and \tacq{PEAKXD} procedures also rely on the sub-arrays, but also rely on numerous patchable (changeable) constants
in the COS flight software (FSW) which assist in target centering.

In both \tacq{IMAGE} and \tacq{PEAKXD}, the internal wavelength calibration lamp is flashed to locate the center of the wavelength calibration aperture (WCA).
From this location, the center of the science aperture (SA) in use, which could be the PSA or BOA, can be predicted by applying the FSW constants that give the SA offset compared to the WCA center. For \tacq{IMAGE},
the offset is in both detector `X' (along-dispersion, AD) and `Y' (cross-dispersion, XD).
For \tacq{PEAKXD}, which uses dispersed light, this offset is only in the Y (XD) direction.
All programs verify that the TA subarrays in use for the given cycle were proper for the \tacq modes tested, verify that the actively used WCA-to-SA offsets, and monitor, as much as possible, the performance of COS TAs.

To combat the effects of FUV gain sag, the FUV \tacq{PEAKXD} algorithm was modified in C19 to only use the FUVA segment. All FUV \tacq{PEAXKD} exposures discussed in this ISR are FUVA-only.
\footnote{The change went into effect on April 18, 2011 (2011.101).}

BOA spectroscopic TAs were not supported during C19--C24, accordingly  the programs discussed here only verify PSA spectroscopic TAs.
WCA-to-PSA offsets are used in \tacq{PEAKXD}s, and each COS grating has a different XD offset. These offsets are both grating (\textsc{OPT\_ELEM})
and lifetime position (LP) dependent.\footnote{In the COS FSW, these WCA-to-SA XD offsets are stored in the \textsc{pcta\_CalTargetOffset} table.}
The programs listed here verify the NUV LP1 as well as FUV LP2\footnote{The default COS FUV spectral location for all \cenwaves was moved from LP1 to LP2 on July 23,2012 (2012.205).} and
LP3\footnote{The default COS FUV spectral location was moved to LP3 on February 15, 2015 (2015.046) for all \cenwaves except G130M/1055 and G130M/1096, which still operate at LP2.
On October 2, 2017 (2017.275), the default FUV spectral location was moved to LP4, with additional observing and TA constraints as outlined on the COS2025 website (http://www.stsci.edu/hst/cos/cos2025).}.
The FUV LP4 uses a different \tacq{PEAKXD} algorithm ({\numpos$>1$), and, like \tacq{PEAKD}, does not use the WCA-to-SA XD offsets\footnote{All NUV and FUV LP1-3 \tacq{PEAKXD} observations use the optional parameter, \numpos=1.}.

The initial HST/COS target pointing is based on definitions of the physical locations of the COS apertures in terms of [V2,V3] in the Science Instrument Aperture File (SIAF).
All of the actively used NUV (LP1) and FUV LP2 and LP3.
SIAF entries used for TA during C21--C24 are also verified in this program.\footnote{These entries are not really really tested that accurately, because ...\dots.}

These programs, and this ISR, do not attempt to monitor the AD accuracy of the COS spectroscopic TA modes.\footnote{For \tacq{PEAKD}, short-term fluctuations of the detector background rate due to environmental conditions remains the largest source of AD pointing error.}

There are 3 modes of COS target acquisition (TA); NUV imaging, NUV and FUV spectroscopic.
There are 4 COS TA (\tacq{}) procedures; \tacq{SEARCH}, \tacq{IMAGE}, \tacq{PEAKD}, and \tacq{PEAKXD}. \tacq{PEAKD}~ and \tacq{SEARCH}~ step the telescope through dwell patterns on the sky. As long as the target light falls completely within
the TA detector subarrays, \tacq{PEAKD}~ and \tacq{SEARCH}~ will continue to operate nominally.
In addition to proper TA subarrays, \tacq{IMAGE}, and \tacq{PEAKXD} \footnote{At FUV LP3, all \tacq{PEAKXD}~observations use the optional parameter {{\bf NUM$\_$POS}\rm}=1.} require accurate TA-associated flight software (FSW) patchable constants.
P14857 verifies that all Cycle~24 NUV and FUV TA subarrays are proper, and evaluates if the actively used WCA-to-PSA offsets\footnote{No BOA spectroscopic TAs were performed in Cycle~24, so these offsets were not verified.} are correct.
The initial HST/COS target pointing is based on definitions of the physical locations of the COS apertures in terms of [V2,V3] in the Science Instrument Aperture File (SIAF).
All of the actively used NUV (LP1) and FUV (LP3\footnote{The default COS FUV spectral location was moved to LP3 on February 15, 2015, for all central wavelength settings except G130M/1055 and G130M/1096, which still operate at LP2. On October 2, 2017, the default location of COS FUV spectra were moved to LP4, with additional observing and TA constraints as outlined on the COS2025 website (http://www.stsci.edu/hst/cos/cos2025).}) SIAF entries used for TA are also verified in this program.

In both \tacq{IMAGE}~ and \tacq{PEAKXD}\footnote{Beginning in Cycle~25, the \tacq{PEAKXD}~algorithm was enhanced so that two distinct algorithms can be employed.
The original \tacq{PEAKXD}, used in Cycles 19-24, is referred to as {{\bf NUM$\_$POS}\rm}=1, while the Cycle~25 (LP4) algorithm
uses the \tacq{PEAKD}~algorithm, but in the cross-dispersion (XD) direction and is referred to as the {{\bf NUM$\_$POS}\rm}~$>1$ \tacq{PEAKXD}.},
 the internal wavelength calibration lamp is flashed to locate the wavelength calibration aperture (WCA). From its measured location on the detector, the center of the science aperture (SA) in use can be predicted by applying the FSW constants that give the SA offset compared to the WCA center for the combination of optics in use.
For \tacq{IMAGE}, the offset is in both the along-dispersion (AD) and cross-dispersion (XD) directions. For \tacq{PEAKXD}, which uses dispersed light, this offset is only in the XD direction.
\begin{itemize}
\item{The \tacq{IMAGE}~procedure has four combinations of two SAs, the Primary Science Aperture (PSA) and the Bright Object Aperture (BOA), and two mirror modes, MIRRORA and MIRRORB. Each combination is commonly used, and has a different WCA-to-SA offset in both AD and XD, which must be verified\footnote{These offsets are maintained in the FSW as the patchable constant tables \textsc{pcta\_ImCalTargetOffset} (XD) and \textsc\textsc{pcta\_YImCalTargetOffset} (AD).}. \tacq{IMAGE}s~also rely on accurate AD and XD plate scales. These physical plate scales should remain constant for the NUV MAMA and are not monitored or tested by this program.
}
\item{The \tacq{PEAKXD}~procedure used in Cycle~24 relies upon FSW XD WCA-to-PSA offsets\footnote{Maintained in the FSW patchable constant table \textsc{pcta\_CalTargetOffset} for both NUV and FUV.}, and grating-specific XD plate scales\footnote{Maintained in the FSW patchable constant tables \textsc{pcta\_NUVMilliArcsecsPerPixelXDisp} and \textsc{pcta\_FUVMilliArcsecsPerPixelXDisp}.}
Each COS grating, SA, and lifetime position (LP) combination has a different offset. This program verifies all 4 NUV LP1 and 3 FUV LP3 grating-specific WCA-to-PSA offsets but does not test or monitor the FSW XD plate scales.
}
\item{This program does not attempt to monitor the AD accuracy of the COS spectroscopic TA modes.\footnote{For \tacq{PEAKD}, short-term fluctuations of the detector background rate due to environmental conditions remains the largest source of along-dispersion pointing error.}
}
\end{itemize}

COS centering requirements are based on wavelength accuracy in the AD, and flux and resolution in the XD. The strictest NUV requirements are [AD,XD] = [0.041, 0.300]\arcsec. For the FUV channel, they are [AD,XD] = [0.106, 0.300]\arcsec. The XD requirement for all TAs is centering to within $\pm$ 0.3\arcsec\ with a 1$\sigma$ goal of $\pm$ 0.1\arcsec.
