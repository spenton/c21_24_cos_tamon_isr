\subsection{Exposure Lists}\label{subsec:elists}

In Visit 01, we take spectra that meet these requirements with the G130M/1309, G140L/1280, G285M/2676, and G230L/3000, and in Visit 02,
we take spectra with the G160M/1600, G185M/1913, G225M/2306. Table ~\ref{tab:peakxd} the results of these exposures are summarized.
The rightmost column gives the WCA-to-PSA offsets measured in \pid{13972}, in arcseconds (\arcsec).
All exposures, except {\sf lcri01h6q}, the G140L/1280 measurement, which showed an offset of 0.15\arcsec\ exceed our $\pm 0.1$\arcsec\ goal.
All exposures exceed our $\pm 0.33$\arcsec\ requirement. The XD profile of G140L spectra is wider that the medium
resolution gratings (G130M and G160M), making in more susceptible to detector `Y-walk' (Penton \& Keyes, 2010).
No action is required at this time as the measured offset is 1/2 of our 0.3\arcsec\ requirement.

The final two exposures of the 02 visit intentionally offset the target by $\pm$ 0.7\arcsec\ to test the effects
of `Y-walk' on G160M \tacq{PEAKXD}s. All three G160M exposures in Visit 02 show offsets from the expected position
of $\le 0.05$\arcsec\ within our 0.1\arcsec\ goal. No action (e.g., updating the \textsc{pcta\_CalTargetOffset} in the FSW)
is required at this time.
