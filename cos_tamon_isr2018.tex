\section{NUV Imaging TA verification}\label{sec:NimVER}
{\bf Note to Reviewers: I am still working with Colin Cox on some details of the
initial pointing offsets that are provided outside of the exposures of these programs (from the telemetry stream that creates the jitter files).

In order to streamline the review process of this ISR, I prefer
to hold back this entire section until this portion of the
analysis has been complete as the offsets from Colin directly
affect the conclusions about the validity of the COS SIAF entries, and all offsets trickle down through all of the bootstrapping
analysis. The current analysis is contained in file ``NimVer.tex''
and this is currently commented out "%\input{NimVer.tex}" directly below
this section in the main .tex file for this ISR (cos\_tamon\_isr2018.tex).
The tables that I think are complete are included in the file ``NimVerT.tex''.}

If you feel this document would be a good place to put that information, it could be added here.}\\

\subsection{[OPTIONAL] SIAF Verification} \label{sec:siaf}\label{subsec:siafextra}
{\bf Note to Reviewers: There are additional details on the COS SIAF entries that can be inferred from the FGS-to-SI alignment program than are documented here. They mostly live in spreadsheet, that
should be in the directory in the repo called ``siaf\_extra''. If you feel this document would be a good place to put that information, it could be added here.
Also, nowhere in any ISR are our SIAF entries documented. If requested, they could be added to the ISR either here or in the appendix.}

\subsection{[OPTIONAL] Importance of S/N to \tacq{IMAGE}} \label{sec:snai}
{\bf Note to Reviewers: A great deal of effort was
exerted in 2017 to analysis the S/N requirement of
\tacq{IMAGE}s. This allowed the relaxing of the S/N requirements that allowed many of the Mdwarf exposures to proceed.
If you feel this document would be a good place to put that information, it could be added here, OR
a new ISR could be initiated to document these efforts. Please let me know your thoughts on this.}

\section{Conclusions.\label{theend} }
\vspace{-0.3cm}
Through constant monitoring, and periodic FSW, ground commanding, and operations updates,
HST+COS TA has performed remarkablely well during Cycles 21--24. The STScI Team thanks the
GSFC and STScI personal for there outstanding cooperation and contributions in these efforts

NUV detector background has been the biggest source of concern
for NUV TAs, while FUV gain-sag induced Y-walk and inherent detector geometric distortions
were the biggest concerns of FUV TAs at LP1--3. At FUV LP4, Y-walk will not be as big a concern as
the \numposone \tacq{PEAKXD} is not affected by either Y-walk or geometric distortions.

{\bf Notes to reviewers: This section will be continue to be completed as the review process continues.}
