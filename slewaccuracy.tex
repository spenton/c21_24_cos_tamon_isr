\section{COS TA Slew Accuracy}\label{sec:slewaccuracy}
The COS telemetry used in the SIAF analysis provides the opportunity to
determine the accuracy of the commanded COS \tacq{IMAGE} slews. As all
COS TA slews use the identical HST commanding, these results should be valid
for all COS TAs.

Table~\ref{tab:fgs2siADXD} compares the slew directions and distances as
reported by the HST telemetry (in [V2,V3]) to those commanded by the initial PSA$\times$MIRA
\tacq{IMAGE} slews (in [AD,XD]\footnote{The COS [AD,XD] slews are reported in the [\textit{ACQPREFX},\textit{ACQPREFY}] fits header keyword.}). during the FGS-to-SI program visits.
In one case (visit `A1' of \pid{13171}), the telemetry before the PSA$\times$MIRA
\tacq{IMAGE} was not available and the instead the slews of the following PSA$\times$MIRB
\tacq{IMAGE} were used. Equations~\ref{eq:ADV23}--\ref{eq:V3ADXD} convert from [V2,V3] to [AD,XD].

\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{PROPOSID} gives the HST program id (PID).
\item \textit{ROOTNAME} gives the IPPPSSOOT of the COS exposure. In all cases but one, the spring C20 exposure of \pid{13171},
this corresponds to the initial PSA$\times$MIRA \tacq{IMAGE}. Due to missing telemetry,
for Spring C20 we have used \textsc{lc6ka1i3q}, the secondary (Config\#2) PSA$\times$MIRB \tacq{IMAGE}.
\item \textit{DATE-OBS} gives the date of the observation in YEAR-MOnth-DAy format.
\item gives the [V2,V3] position difference (in \arcsec) before and after the \tacq{IMAGE} exposure as reported by HST telemetry.
\item gives the [AD,XD] position difference (in \arcsec) before and after \tacq{IMAGE} exposure.
\item gives the [AD,XD] position difference (in \arcsec) before and after \tacq{IMAGE} exposure as reported by the COS header keywords [\textit{ACQPREFX},\textit{ACQPREFY}].
\item gives the [AD,XD] position difference (in \arcsec) between the HST telemetry and COS header keyword
reported slews.
\item ``SIAF Entry'' gives the [V2,V3] entries that were active at the time of the observations of this row.\end{enumerate}
\normalsize

These results indicate that, on average, the observed HST slews agree with the \tacq{IMAGE} commanded slews to $\Delta$[AD,XD]=[-0.002,-0.006]\arcsec{},
with an RMS difference of [AD,XD]=[0.003,0.010]\arcsec{}.
