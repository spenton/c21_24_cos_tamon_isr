\tablenotetext{a}{An average of the AD and XD platescales was used to estimate the uncertainty (in \arcsec) in column 7.}
\tablecomments{To determine the co-alignment of \tacq{IMAGE} configuration\#2 to configuration\#1. config\#2 is the base configuration, use that
row at the config\#1 column to determine the co-alignment. The alignment order is that if a config\#1 \tacq{IMAGE} is followed by a config\#2 \tacq{IMAGE},
one should expect the  given \textit{ACQSLEWX} and \textit{ACSLEWY}.
Final co-alignment averages over C21--24 are shown in bold, with the uncertainties also indicated in bold.}
