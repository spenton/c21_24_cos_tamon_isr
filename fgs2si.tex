\subsection{FGS-to-SI Programs}\label{subsec:fgs2si}

From Cycles 17-23, an FGS-to-SI program executed with COS visits twice a year. These programs contained COS exposures designed to assist in the monitoring of the COS NUV alignent to HST.
These programs used the same two target stars with COS in visits spaced six months apart. Both visits observed the astrometric open cluster M35, at orientations that were 180\degree~apart.
The two stars observed were 206W3 (in the Fall) and 427W3 (in the Spring). Due to time constraints, the exact content of the COS visits in these programs varied from year to year.

However, the COS portion of each program begins with a PSA+MIRRORA \texttt{ACQ/IMAGE} on a target should be approximately centered due to observations with other instruments earlier in the visit.
Post-observation telemetry data, an the results of the \texttt{ACQ/IMAGE}, are used to refine this assumption.
This process verifies the COS NUV PSA aperture position\footnote{Specifically, the \textit{LFPSAA} entry.} in the SIAF to about 0.5 pixels or (~0.012\arcsec).

After this PSA+MIRRORA \texttt{ACQ/IMAGE}, a PSA+MIRRORB \texttt{ACQ/IMAGE} is then performed (together, a ``set'').
This bootstraps the PSA+MIRRORB centering to the PSA+MIRRORA and to the SIAF verification.
This allows us to monitor the properties of the PSA+MIRRORB image in a controlled way on a centered target.

The historical list of FGS-to-SI proposals, HST cycles (C\#\#), and content are given in Table~\ref{tab:fgs2si}.
Where possible, time-tag (TT) images of the lamps and/or targets, along with NUV G230L spectra were acquired.
